Shortly after his arrival, he had an audience with Emperor Wu Di of the Liang dynasty, whom he offended by discoursing on how far the emperor had strayed from the path to true enlightenment. He travelled north and founded his own sect and the Shaolin Temple near Mount Song in Henan province where he taught that enlightenment could be attained through chan, or meditation. Legends about Damo are closely related to the way he is depicted. He is said to have meditated with intense concentration for nine years while facing a wall of a cave near the Shaolin temple he founded. He is, therefore, depicted with a large forehead and intensely bulging eyes symbolizing his concentration, wisdom, soberness, and dedication.

(15.9 x 19.1 cm),"The decorative subject matter on this pot is especially appropriate for the scholarâ€™s desk. It illustrates a scene from one of Chinaâ€™s most important prose poems, The Red Cliff. The author, Su Dongbo or Su Shi (1037-1101), lived during the end of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127). Not only was Su Shi a leading literary figure, he was also a prominent artist and closely identified with the literati rather than the court approach to painting. He was not only a practitioner but also an art theorist, who advocated that painting did not need formal likeness but should appear to be spontaneous in execution. He also felt that painting needed to be grounded in the achievements of recognized past masters. The Red Cliff poems were the subject a number of paintings from the late Northern Song Dynasty on. The boating scene depicted is referred to in the poem. As a vessel made for the literati, the four-character mark applied to the bottom of the pot, wen zhang shan dou (Writings earning great respect), is especially apt. It has been speculated that this mark appears exclusively on blue and white brush pots of the Kangxi period painted with landscapes and figures. A brush pot with a similar mark dated to the Kangxi period is illustrated in Popular Pottery and Enameled Porcelain of the Qing Period. There are two brush pots of roughly the same size as the Loweâ€™s bearing this mark in the collection of the Shanghai Museum of Art, both having narrative style paintings. One has a long prose inscription, Ode of the Autumn Sound.

The Chinese had re-established full control of the kilns by the late 17th century and were able, due to their larger production capacity, to displace the Japanese from the market by the early 18th century.

(1.9 x 13 cm),"Viet Nam has a long history of producing high-quality ceramics that were exported widely to Southeast Asia and beyond. But from the mid-18th to the end of the 19th century, the Vietnamese royal courts in Hue and Hanoi placed orders for high quality porcelain decorated with underglaze cobalt blue. This ware has come to be called â€œBleu de Hueâ€� and is distinguished from the ceramic output for both the domestic and foreign market by the thickness of the potting as well as a distinctly heavy, flattened foot ring. The Vietnamese rulers felt that imported goods, including ceramics, better demonstrated the noblility of the royal court than domestic wares. It was, therefore, not unusual for the court to place special orders for Chinese ceramics, which were regarded as technically more advanced than those manufactured locally. In the early 19th century, after the Nguyen unifed Viet Nam, a royal decree was made ordering that all royal utensils for use at the court, including those originally in Hanoi, be brought to the Imperial capital at Hue. This piece, executed in the style of a traditional Chinese painting, includes a ten-character poem and two seals. The first appears to be the character zhong (center or middle) in a round cartouche and the second xi (evening) in a square cartouche. The poem translates: â€œThe withered branches are reflective of the bitterness of winter; Mr. Nian fears the emptiness of the store.â€� The two-character inscription on the foot is the Vietnamese nom equivalent of tran ngoan, precious curio or trinket. A precise date for this piece is difficult, but, based on stylistic evidence, it would appear to have been manufactured in the mid-19th century.",not found in JSON,1,Asia,#848380

This saucer dish may have been produced prior to the destruction of the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen in 1855. The kiln was not rebuilt until 1866, or the 5th year of the succeeding Tongzhi reign and so wares produced by the imperial kilns of this period are limited. There are similar saucer dishes from the subsequent Tongzhi (1861-1874), Guangxu (1875-1908), and Xuantong (1908-1911) periods. Although the lotus is indigenous to China, the introduction of Buddhism attached new significance to the flower, and it has remained closely associated with the Buddhist faith. The lotus became a symbol of purity for Buddhists because it rises clean and stainless out of the muddy water in which it grows. By the Song Dynasty (960-1279), the flower apparently lost most of its specific Buddhist significance. Its symbolic meaning was absorbed into the secular emblems, and it developed new and typically Chinese attributes. The lotus was praised as the flower of purity and integrity, the symbol of the perfect or princely man. The honesty of an uncorrupt official was symbolized by lotus flowers and egrets (the bird also kept clean in the same muddy waters). The lotus had other symblic meanings as well. It was the emblem of summer among the Flowers of the Four Seasons, conveying the idea of happiness in maturity.",not found in JSON,1,Asia,#929496

Very few lines, as in this example, were used to create the extremely complex design, which are this styleâ€™s signature. Fitzhugh is a name given to this style by Western merchants, or possibly later by dealers. The nameâ€™s origin has been the subject of much debate. It is speculated that the name references a British East India Companyâ€™s Director, one of several engaged in the China trade. Since the style originated in the 1790â€™s, its principal importance was to the United States. But the style is also known in both England and Portugal. The Fitzhugh pattern occurs primarily in underglaze cobalt blue, but other colors include green, rouge-de-fer orange (iron red), and sepia. Of all the colors green was extremely variable and difficult to control, so that the product appears in a wide range of tonality and with varying degrees of blurring or running.

Japanese Imari was so popular that the Chinese imitated the decoration, called Chinese Imari, and shipped it to Europe until the 1730s.",not found in JSON,1,Asia,#b8b9be

The leader of the three brothers, Liu Bei, who claimed descent from the Han imperial family, eventually became ruler of the Lesser Han dynasty during the Three Kingdoms period (220-265). Guan Yu was posthumously ennobled as a Duke in the twelfth century and eventually deified in 1594.

Since the Indians believed that their gods had feminine and masculine aspects, it was not difficult for the Chinese to emphasize those female attributes. Four main feminine forms of Guanyin appear in China after the Tang Dynasty â€“ the most popular being the white-robed Guanyin, who had the power to bestow sons, and it was this power that made this foreign goddess popular.

Once enough ink has collected in the cavity, the scholar/artist dips the brush, removing the excess on the flat surface before applying the ink to paper. Along with the brush, ink, and paper, the stone was considered one of the Four Treasures of the scholarâ€™s studio and were prominently displayed on the scholarâ€™s desk.Chinese ink was made of glue obtained by boiling animal bones and hides and mixing this with soot obtained by burning wood or leaves. Pine soot was considered the best, and consequently, the most expensive admixture. These two basic components were mixed with others; each recipe being a closely guarded family secret. The final mixture was then pressed into molds with different decorative motifs. As in all the arts related to literati activities, there were a number of celebrated ink makers, whose work was the more appreciated and hence more sought after.Although produced in great quantities, it unusual to find a full set of unused ink cakes from the pre-Republican era. Like all the objects used in the scholarâ€™s studio, the selection of ink cakes was very personal. The wealthiest literati could patronize the most famous ink cake artists, many of who are recorded. These nine cakes are decorated with famous landscapes on one side and poetic descriptions on the other.",1.588,1,Asia,#4a4037

This stone was quarried near Shaoxing and was particularly sought after for its surface texture, which was believed to lend a distinctive quality to the ink. It depicts a shallow pool with aquatic creatures, including the crab, fish, and turtle. The Chinese word for crab (xie) is a homophone of the word (xie), designating those who passed the metropolitan examinations, which was the first step toward official rank. The Chinese word for fish (yu) is a homophone of the word (yu), which means surplus or excess as it relates to wealth. The combination of these three animals probably forms the rebus: â€œMay you successfully pass the metropolitan examinations, gain office, fortune and enjoy a long life.â€� It is likely that this ink stone was presented as a gift from a close friend.",14.605,1,Asia,#785e49

The fan shape is most effectively used in the successful execution of this composition. The arrangement of the tall distant mountain peaks in the background leading gradually to the lower hills in the foreground also strongly suggest a perspectival view of the landscape. This method of achieving perspective began to be employed in China by the Tang Dynasty and was perfected during the Northern Son Dynasty (960-1127).

The documents chronicle the rise of a family of humble origins to nobility within the Qing empire. The history begins with Pien-zhu who was given a title for his participation in a southward campaign into Shandong province and the subjugation of the prefecture of Bien-jin. He is subsequently recognized for his services in surpressing bandits in Dong-chang Fu, where he lost his life. As a reward for this valorous service, an hereditary title and promotion was bestowed on his elder brother, Hun-zhu in the 4th year, 12th month, 17th day of the reign of the Shunzhi emperor (1648). With the unification of the empire under the Manchu, Qing dynasty, Pien-zhu's family was given an additional title on the occasion of ascendancy of the Empress Dowager (1651).

(25.4 x 10.2 cm),"The shape and decoration of this vase are characteristic of many of the finest ceramics of the Kangxi period. The shape seems to appear in the early Kangxi period. It has a neck with a thick flaring rim-form mouth, and a wide shoulder curving down slightly to the foot. In the famille-verte palette, the neck, as in this case, often bears a sprig of bamboo executed in black overglaze enamels. The shoulder has a diaper pattern in overglaze enamels with two reserve panels illustrating the eternal knot, one of the eight Buddhist treasures. The main body of the vase is decorated exclusively in overglaze enamels â€“ in this case, a single bird on a plum tree branch. The decoration appears to have been inspired by the academic album-leaf painting of the late Northern Song dynasty (960-1127) and very possibly from Northern Song paintings in the imperial collections. The perpendicular foot is unglazed and there is no mark on the base. The application of reign marks, while common in the Ming Dynasty, was apparently forbidden by imperial edict in 1677.

(104.8 x 144.8 cm),"This jacket would have been worn over an embroidered skirt. The designs include floral sprays and medallions containing historical as well as mythological and dramatic scenes. Animals, both real and imaginary, also decorate the garment. The most elaborate embroideries, brocade, and tapestries were produced by the Chinese during the Qing Dynasty, particularly during the reign of the Emperor Qianlong (1736-1795). During his reign the court robes of the emperors and empresses, court ladies and officials, were remodeled to suit the seasons of the year and different official occasions. These robes began to appear on the market soon after the abdication in 1912 of the last Qing emperor, Xuantung (1908-1911). Most Western collections of Chinese robes were established between 1924, the year Xuantung left the Imperial Palace, and the late 1930s, when court robes flooded onto the market. It is possible that this robe made its way onto the market during this period.",not found in JSON,1,Asia,#8f7e65
