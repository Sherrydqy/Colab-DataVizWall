(81.3 x 80 x 14 cm),"Among the events of Christâ€™s infancy, the Adoration of the Magi was important from the standpoint of Catholic dogma because it was the moment when Christâ€™s divinity was revealed for the first time to the Gentiles, as represented by the three kings. Originally, this painting was the left-hand wing of a three-panel altarpiece in the Riminese church of San Francesco. The name given the anonymous master responsible for this charming painting is derived from the subject matter of the altarpieceâ€™s other wing, which depicted the vision of the blessed penitent, Clare of Rimini (1262-1328). Like his Riminese contemporaries, the Master of the Blessed Clare maintained certain Byzantine traditions, such as the red couch on which the Virgin reclines, the gold striations of her gown and the robes of Saint Joseph, and the use of a hierarchical scale. At the same time, the emphasis on human interaction, clarity of space, and figural solidity show the influence of the great Florentine master Giotto di Bondone (1266-1337).",13.97,1,Europe,#a18986

(162.6 x 162.6 x 8.9 cm),"The Annunciation was one of the most popular subjects of Italian Medieval and Renaissance religious painting because of its doctrinal significance as the moment of the Incarnation, the embodiment of Christ in human form. This large rectangular altarpiece, painting for an unknown church in Tuscany, represents the last phase of the Annunciation drama, following the Virgin's initial reaction of fear and hesitation to Gabriel's pronouncement that she was to be the mother of Christ. The inscription at the bottom of the painting provides the textual source for the events: ""Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to Thy words"" (Luke 1:38). The Virgin's humble acceptance of her destiny is indicated by her posture: her head is bowed and her hands are crossed upon her breast. Mary's thoughts are recorded on the pages of the open book on the reading stand in front of her: ""My soul [doth magnify] the Lord and my spirit hath rejoined [in God my savior]"" (Luke: 1:46-47). The golden rays that extent from the upper righthand corner of the composition are those of the Holy Spirit (in the form of a white dove), sent as a sign of divine love by God the Father (whose figure was obliterated when the painting was cut down approximately five inches at the right). The rectangular format of The Annunciation, the classicizing architecture, and the antique lettering used for the inscriptions demonstrate that Bicci was affected to a limited degree by contemporary Renaissance innovations.",8.89,1,Europe,#b28a51

Michelangelo frequently supplied his friend with drawings, usually figural studies for religious subjects, which Venusti employed in the design of his paintings, including the Loweâ€™s work. The Annunciation is a small-scale copy of a larger work painted by Venusti for the cathedral of Rome that was based on drawings of the subject by Michelangelo. A drawing for Venustiâ€™s Annunciation, according to Giorgio Vasari, was given by Michelangeloâ€™s nephew, Lionardo, after his uncleâ€™s death to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo deâ€™ Medici. The acclaim accorded the Lateran Annunciation in sixteenth-century Rome led the artist to replicate it not only in the Lowe painting, but in several other, small-scale versions of the composition.",7.62,not found in JSON,Europe,#363438

(67.9 x 54 cm)Framed: 34 1/4 x 27 3/4 x 4 in. (87 x 70.5 x 10.2 cm),"The Annunciation and the Journey to Bethlehem originally formed the upper right-hand corner of a large altarpiece, the exact format of which is unknown. The two scenes were part of the series illustrating either the infancy of Christ or the life of the Virgin, which may have served as the backdrop to an image of the Madonna and Child Enthroned; in that case, the cornice and pilaster at the far left of the panel may have been part of the Virginâ€™s throne. However, it is more likely that the foreground of the picture was occupied by a scene of the Nativity. This is suggested by the lower edge of the classical entablature, which, before it was partially repainted by an overzealous restorer, appeared as a ruin. In Renaissance painting, the setting for the birth of Christ often included a ruined classical building symbolizing the eclipse of the old dispensation. The departure of the Virgin and Joseph for Bethlehem was a subject rarely depicted in Italian medieval and Renaissance art. It is also highly unusually that in the scene of the Annunciation, the archangel Gabriel is portrayed carrying a palm branch, thereby reflecting Danteâ€™s description of the Incarnation (Il Paradiso 32.112-14). The works of Cozzarelli, a painter of miniatures, altarpieces, and cassone panels (secular paintings used to decorate furniture), are frequently confused with those of his presumed master, Matteo di Giovanni (active 1452-1495). The format of Cozzarelliâ€™s paintings and his feeling for decorative detail and textural richness are in the Sienese stylistic tradition, but his interest in perspective, naturalistic movement, classical architecture, and antique ornamentation reflects the significant influence of contemporary Florentine art.",10.16,not found in JSON,Europe,#cca280

In addition to the decoration on the arch of the Annunciate Angel and Annunciate Virgin, the monument was decorated with four narrative reliefs with scenes from the life of St. Jerome, currently in the collection of the Palazzo Venezia in Rome, emphasizing his erudition and sanctity as one of the premier theologians of the early Christian church.

Hagar was the Egyptian hand-maiden of Sarah, the wife of the patriarch, Abraham. The older, barren, Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham, and the son who was born to them was Ishmael. Sarah, who eventually gave birth to Isaac, banished Hagar and Ishmael, after being insulted by the younger woman. After Hagar and Ishmael ran out of food and water, God intervened and saved them. Ishmael grew to manhood and became the father of twelve sons. The Islamic religion reveres him as a patriarch.",4.445,not found in JSON,Europe,#5f412d

The Bishareen appear once to have had a fair idea of their own history, and there are reports that before the time of the Mahdi in the 1880s, they possessed some written accounts of their traditions. They lived in an area stretching from Aswan southward to Berber on the Nile River and Kassala on the Atbara River. Perhaps descendents of the earlier nomadic Bedja and Blemmyes, their legendary birthplace was Gebel Elba, near Aidhab; their name is traced to an eponymous ancestor ""Bishar."" Armed with broad swords, large round hide shields, at times caparisoned in chain mail passed down from the Middle Ages, their camel-mounted warriors were visions of the Prophet's own men. During the Mahdist wars in the Sudan, they were of somewhat divided loyalties: some followed the Mahdist chief Osman Digna, others annihilated Mahdist raiding parties, and some served as native irregulars with the British. Following the defeat of the Khalifa by the British at Omdurman, the Bishareen declined. Although this group portrait bears no signature, the two women reappear as models in at least one other photograph signed ""Zangaki.""",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#b0aaa4

Created as a pair, they were displayed in a private chapel of wealthy Tuscan home to serve as inspiration for personal devotions and moral instruction. In his treatise on the family, the Dominican Cardinal Giovanni Dominici (died 1419) recommended that young mothers adorn their houses with pictures and statues of the young Jesus and the Baptist as models for the children. Christâ€™s virtues were infinite, whereas the Baptist (who was also the patron saint of Florence) was considered exemplar of self-control and humility. The notion of creating a portrait likeness of a saint evolved out of the tradition of medieval reliquaries, in which the bust served as the container for a relic. The 15th century Florentine vogue for bust portraits of Christ and the Baptist as young children was initiated by the talented marble sculptor, Desiderio da Settignano (1428-1464). Although they are clearly indebted to Desiderioâ€™s innovative imagery, in physical appearance and material the two busts more closely resemble the work of Andrea della Robbia (1435-1525), who inherited a flourishing sculptural workshop from his uncle Luca (1400-1482). Luca introduced the technique for applying various colors of glazes to pottery figures, but it was Andrea who popularized polychrome glazed terracotta as a vehicle for mass-produced religious sculpture. The two busts may be commercial products of Andreaâ€™s late workshop, but it is also possible that they were produced by another Florentine shop that had its productions glazed by the Della Robbia.",127,1,Europe,#1d2325

(54 x 70.2 x 8.9 cm),"Gauguin frequently visited his artistic mentor, Camille Pissarro (1830-1903), in Pontoise, a market town about thirty-two kilometers northwest of Paris. In the 1870s and early 1880s, under Pissarro's influence, Gauguin often painted subjects of rustic life, concentrating on farmers and workers in lightstruck landscapes. Together they painted along the banks of the River Oise, which is seen in ""The Barge and the Boat."" During this period, Gauguin adopted the Impressionist method of painting outdoors, spontaneously noting effects of tone and color in small, broken brushstrokes that heavily textured the surface of his paintings. Later, beginning in 1888, Gauguin broke with Impressionist practice and moved away from naturalism. His pictures then took on the characteristics of his own mature style, in which forms are flattened into decorative compositions, and colors are applied in large, unbroken areas. ""Do not paint too much from nature,"" he advised a younger artist at that time, ""rather, dream in front of it."" The Lowe's picture, although painted in Gauguin's early Impressionist style, is particularly interesting because it anticipates the artist's later use of flattened forms (as in the prow of the small boat in the lower left) and his tendency toward abstracted and symbolic composition.",8.89,not found in JSON,Europe,#3a3f32

Christina and A Principal Woman of Sta. Christina",Art Works,Artist Unknown,Sheet: 9 3/4 x 13 7/8 in. (24.8 x 35.2 cm),"In all three of his voyages, Cook spent much of his time exploring the islands of Polynesia. Throughout the region, he encountered highly stratified societies ruled by hereditary chiefs to whom genealogy was of extreme importance. Native art forms, including costume and body ornamentation, announced and negotiated the social order in Polynesia, mediating between the elite status and power of royals and their subjects. The chief at Santa Christina (Tahuata, Marquesas Islands) is shown with facial tattoos, wearing a feather headdress, an elaborate necklace, and mother-of-pearl ornaments on either side of his face. The naturalist, J.R. Forster (German, 1729-1798), described the chief he encountered during the second voyage: â€œWhen dressâ€™d they wear on the fore head as an ornament a curious fillet of shell work decorated with feathers etc, round the neck a kind of Ruff made of wood decorated with small red pease which are stuck on with gum and bunches of human hair fastened to a string and tyed round the legs and arms; in this manner was the chief who came to visit us dressâ€™d.â€�Hoggâ€™s version lacks the details of the original engraving by John Hall (English, 1739-1797) after a sketch by Hodges. The ornamentation on the headdress has been simplified, as have the chiefâ€™s facial tattoos, although Hodges did not depict the facial tattooing he observed as comprehensively as Parkinson had during the first voyage. Hodges also sketched a woman from Santa Christina, which was subsequently engraved by Hall, but Hogg has chosen instead to endow his principal woman of Santa Christina with facial features very similar to those of his chief. The two are presented as mirror images, set apart only by their costumes and ornamentation.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#7c6e59

Although the penalty for adultery according to Mosaic law was death by stoning, Jesus admonishes the crowd: â€œHe who is without sin â€¦, let him first cast a stone at her.â€� Left alone with the woman once the shame-faced crowd disperses, Jesus tells her: â€œNeither do I condemn you, and from now on sin no more.â€� Conflating the beginning and end of the story, Marconi depicts a dense group of scribes and Pharisees in front of a temple, with Christ at the center blessing the adulteress.

(99.4 x 76.2 x 7.6 cm),"The size, format, and subject matter of this painting suggest that it was a private devotional image. The figure was derived ultimately from Giovanni Bellini's ca. 1487 figure of Christ in the Transfiguration (Naples, Capodimonte). It is one among twenty-three versions cited by Fritz Heinemann (1962). In light of the fact that all other contemporary copies include a landscape or architectural setting, it is probable that this painting originally had some sort of background which has now been painted over. The authorship of this painting has been controverted. Fern R. Shapley ascribed it to an artist of the Venetian School, ca.1500. Heinemann initially associated the work with Girolamo Mocetto, but subsequently agreed with the attribution to Benedetto Diana proposed by Antonio Paolucci and seconded by Burton B. Fredericksen and Federico Zeri.",7.62,not found in JSON,Europe,#1c171b

The structure was the largest of any of the mortuary temples of the New Kingdom, but it was somewhat hastily built. Over time the extensive mudbrick elements of the structure melted, and later rulers quarried away what stone they found. During the Graeco-Roman period, the northern statue of the group (to the right) came to be known as the Colossus of Memnon. Memnon was a warrior who led the Ethiopian allies of the Trojans against the Greeks during the struggle for Troy. Because the prenomen of Amenhotep III, Nebmaatra, was pronounced as Nimmaria or Mimmaria, his name was conflated with the Memnon of the Trojan War. The colossal statues of Amenhotep III were damaged by an earthquake, probably in 27 BCE., and the northernmost colossus began to make a ""singing"" sound, probably caused by the night dew sublimating in the rising heat of morning, which was interpreted as the voice of Memnon calling to his mother, Aurora, the dawn. The Roman emperor Septimus Severus repaired the singing colossus, and it has ceased to sing down to the present day.",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#bdbcb6

Apollo is the young man at the far right dressed in armor, with light emanating from his head alluding to his role as the sun god. He is depicted playing a lira da braccio, a bow-stringed instrument popular in the Renaissance. The seated figure holding a large set of pan-pipes is probably Pan, although he is depicted as an older man rather than as a satyr. The third figure from the left, seated in the middle of the spectators, is perhaps Timolus, the mountain god and judge of the contest. The figure at the far left may be King Midas who also witnessed the contest and contradicted Timolusâ€™ decision, thereby incurring the wrath of Apollo who turned his ears into those of an ass. This painting was formerly attributed to the Venetian artist, Jacopo Tintoretto (1519-1594), and was, for a period of time, titled The Judgment of Midas.",7.62,1,Europe,#46301e

(72.4 x 52.1 x 7.6 cm),"The Crucifixion is an unusually well-preserved example of the earliest form of panel painting in Italy. Following the tradition of Byzantine icons, the surface and the frame were carved from a single piece of wood, with the picture plane recessed and the original thickness of the wood forming a flat band around the perimeter. Originally, this small rectangular painting was connected by hinges with another panel, most likely depicting the Madonna and Child. The Crucifixion was a common subject in Byzantine and earlier medieval art, but the dramatic treatment of the theme, as seen here, originated in the work of Giotto di Bondone (1266-1337). Giotto made the decisive break with Byzantine traditions, then dominant in Italian painting, by combining the expression of human feeling and character with a new attitude toward form in relation to the surrounding space. His stylistic innovations were influential for painters throughout Italy, but above all for the artists working in his native Florence. The unknown Florentine master who painted this Crucifixion belonged to the first generation of Giottesque painters.",7.62,1,Europe,#6d4e24

The raised deck was reserved for the use of passengers, and the lower deck was frequented by the crew of the craft. Dahabiyehs were slow-traveling vessels, and men and animals had often to tow them against the current of the Nile. As temperatures rose in the spring, the demand for the boats decreased, and most of the crews returned to summer farming until autumn again brought the return of tourists.",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#c4c1be

Zangaki, who lived and worked in Egypt and Palestine beginning around 1870. Like Hippolyte Arnoux, who documented with his camera the construction of the Suez Canal, the Zangakis worked out of Port Said. Photographs like this answered a popular demand for the odalisque, a purported glimpse inside of the fabled harems of the Orient. Such disparate literary sources as Sir Richard Burton's translation of the Arabian Nights and travelers' descriptions of the AlmÃ©es, or dancing courtesans of Egypt, blended together in the Western imagination, blurring the line between lascivious courtesans and the sequestered inhabitants of the harem, resulting in coquettish images like this one.",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#4c4341

In the Egyptian Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2060-1785 BCE), the image of the soul of the dead taking its leisure beneath a tree is inimical, for danger lurks in the shadows. By the time of the New Kingdom (ca. 1560-1085 BCE), however, this had changed, and the soul of the dead is often shown drinking water in the shade of a palm. T he goddesses Hathor and Nut, providing food for the souls in the Hereafter, were at times depicted as trees, and the dead man could desire a metamorphosis into a dom-palm - a manifestation of the potent fertility god Min. The fruit of the date palm was one of the chief sweeteners of the ancients, and, as in antiquity, all parts of the palm tree are still used by the Egyptians.

In this depiction of the story, the scene of the great horse on wheels being pushed into the city occupies only a small portion of the composition. The rest of the painting is devoted to the sensual activities of multitudes of Trojans who make merry with abandon. Eating, drinking, and playing music, they are wholly unaware of impending disaster, symbolized by the dark storm clouds gathering above the city. Gillis van Valckenborch, like many Northern artists in this period, made a trip to Italy in 1595 where he saw the work of the Italian Mannerists. The impact of this experience on the painterâ€™s style may be seen in the Loweâ€™s painting in his large animated groups of nude and semi-nude figures; deep plunge into depth from foreground to background; dramatic lighting effects and decorative colors. The composition was inspired by the 1587 engraving of the marriage of Cupid and Psyche by the Dutch Mannerist Hendrick Goltzius.",8.255,1,Europe,#6f554b

Accurately Engraved from a Drawing made on the spot purposely for this Work by A. Hogg.",Art Works,Artist Unknown,Sheet: 9 3/4 x 14 3/8 in. (24.8 x 36.5 cm),"Despite the caption, Webber was not present when Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on February 14, 1779. His depiction of the scene was painted in England, and likely sourced from first-hand accounts, although these were not all consistent. Cook had departed Kealakekua Bay but returned a few days later to repair damage to the Resolutionâ€™s foremast. With the end of the Makahiki festival, Hawaiian veneration of Cook had waned and he encountered a very different response from the native population. Attempting to resolve a number of thefts, he went ashore with several others and amongst confusion and aggression on both sides, was stabbed in the back.Webber shows Cook, dressed in a white naval uniform, standing in front of a large mob of angry Hawaiians, holding up his hand in an effort to stop his men from firing on the crowd. Just behind the Captain, a Hawaiian man in a feathered cloak holds his knife aloft about to strike the deathblow. Reports indicated that Cook had, in fact, fired into the crowd in an effort to disperse it, and had killed another man but Webber has altered the event to depict Cook as a heroic defender of peace, valiantly trying to stop his men from firing on the crowd, his rifle held passively at his side. For the European viewer, Cook was not a participant in the aggressions that led to his death, but an innocent casualty, tragically killed while attempting to keep his men from firing on the crowd. In Hoggâ€™s version, the scale of the event has been reduced, the figures of both Cook and his attacker have been altered, and the composition is reversed. More significantly, he has added a caption designed to confirm the legitimacy of his image, sending the message to his readers that they could believe the authenticity of his version because it had been drawn on-site especially for the publication.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#7b6b55

Panofsky, in ""Gods, Saints and Heroes,"" comments that the original Cornelisz van Haarlem painting of 1592, ""The Fall of Man,"" may be based on Albrect Durer's 1504 engraving ""Fall of Man."" The animals in the painting have a symbolic function. The dog is the good teacher who watches over the human spirit and punishes people's sins. The choleric cat on Adam's side (on Eve's side in the 1592 Cornelisz van Haarlem version) is the symbol of her cunning cruelty.",6.35,not found in JSON,Europe,#d6a782

(24.8 x 36.2 cm),"Cook landed at Dusky Sound, New Zealand in March of 1773 after months of sailing throughout the Antarctic Circle during which his two ships, the Resolution and the Discovery, had become separated and most of his crew had begun to experience the effects of scurvy. He had visited New Zealand during his first voyage, but had been met with significant hostility and resistance from the native Maori. At Dusky Sound, however, Cook encountered a small Maori family, likely members of the nomadic Ngati Mamoe tribe, who were more accepting of the Europeans. Hodges sketched the Maori family at Dusky Sound and, upon his return to England, painted additional scenes depicting Maori figures against sublime, tropical landscapes and sunsets. In Hoggâ€™s engraving, a Maori man sits in the foreground to the right while women and children lounge behind him in their verdant natural surroundings. Some attention has been paid to ethnographic detail in the spear the man holds and the club attached to his belt, but his facial features are more European, as are those of the women and children. With their dreamy expressions and classical figures, the Maori family epitomizes the romantic view of the noble savage and a neoclassical interest in figural simplicity and grace.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#5a4b39

Plantations and cultivation were expanding at the end of the 19th century, and transformed the way of life of many people, especially the Maya women who came to work picking coffee beans. These women lived together on the plantation during the harvest, and returned home to their villages when it finished. The same arrangement exists today.

(85.1 x 116.8 x 10.2 cm),"The Flight into Egypt is representative of a new genre of painting, the cabinet picture, which originated in the early sixteenth century. Small-scale easel paintings such as this were produced for private consumption and therefore were not constrained by conventional expectations in regard to content. In The Flight into Egypt, the biblical event is illustrated in a novel fashion that conveys the familial intimacy of the Holy Family. Whereas in earlier Italian art Joseph is always shown on foot leading the mule on which Mary and the Christ Child ride, here he rides his own mule and carries the sleeping Christ Child in a wooden cradle. Joseph turns in the saddle to face Mary and points vigorously to the trail, whereas she appears to be forewarning him that a closed gateway lies directly in their path. Like Garofalo, Dosso and his younger brother, Battista, worked chiefly in Ferrara for the Este court. Painted after Battistaâ€™s return from Rome, where he worked in Raphaelâ€™s shop from 1517-1520, The Flight into Egypt is one of many collaborative undertakings by the two painters.",10.16,1,Europe,#221d21

(9.5 x 87.6 cm),"Bacchiaccaâ€™s painting illustrates the tragic tale from the Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375) of the princess Ghismonda and her lover Guiscardo, a servant at her fatherâ€™s court. Following the discovery of his daughterâ€™s illicit affair, Prince Tancredi orders Guiscardo strangled and his heart cut out; he sends it to Ghismonda in a chalice with a note: â€œYour father sends you this to comfort you with that which you loved most â€¦â€� In the painting, Ghismonda is shown weeping over Guiscardoâ€™s heart, surrounded by distraught ladies-in-waiting; the bottle below her feet presumably holds the poison that she drinks at the end of the story. The shape of the panel, the presence of coats-of-arms on the reverse, and its subject matter of true love are typical features of a desco da sposa (or desco delle nozze), a round painting used to carry gifts to a new bride as part of the marriage customs of the elite merchant class of Renaissance Florence.",9.525,1,Europe,#483825

(40.6 x 50.8 cm),"Carved from limestone bedrock during the Old Kingdom (ca. 2800-2350 BCE) as an image of Harmachis, the rising sun, the Sphinx was from time to time buried up to its neck by the encroaching Libyan sands. During the New Kingdom (ca. 1560-1085 BCE) it became popular for royal princes holding military posts in Memphis to ride their chariots across the ancient pyramid fields, perhaps in ritualized exhibition of their martial prowess. The stela of Thutmosis IV, visible in this photo between the front paws of the Sphinx, tells of how the prince Thutmosis was accustomed to drive his chariot round and round the Sphinx. One day he went to sleep in the shadow of the Sphinx, and the god Harmachis himself appeared to the young man in a dream, complaining of the sand which burdened his colossal image and promising the throne to the prince if he would clear away the sand. Evidently both Thutmosis IV and Harmachis kept their word. This photograph was taken after Ã‰mile Baraize completed his excavations of the Sphinx in 1934 and before Selim Hassan began new work on the site in 1936. The pyramid of Khafra (Chefren) is visible to the right; those of Menkaura (Mycerinus) and one of his queens to the left.",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#958f92

(135.9 x 102.9 x 7.6 cm),"The Harttung Family Epitaph is a rare, early example of a Lutheran memorial, modeled after the earliest Protestant epitaphs created by Lucas Cranach the Elder. Donated to a Protestant church by the Harttung family in honor of two deceased relatives, Elisabeth (d. 1553) and her husband, Heronimus (d. 1539), the commemorative inscription at the bottom of the painting concludes with a petition on the part of the donors for mercy on the souls of the deceased and the expression of hope for resurrection. The painting depicts the couple kneeling in a landscape with members of their immediate family, and looking upward at a large figure of Christ resurrected, triumphant over Death, symbolized here by a skeleton, and Evil, represented by Satan. Illustrated to the left and right of Christ are the biblical scenes alluding to the Resurrection, of Jonah and the Whale and Ezekiel in the Valley. In the former scene, Protestant propaganda is conveyed by the image of Jonah being thrown overboard by a member of the Catholic Church.",7.62,1,Europe,#3a2f2d

(154.9 x 132.1 cm),"It was only in 1580s, at a point when her reputation was well established, that Sofonisba Anguissola began to paint multi-figure religious themes such as the Loweâ€™s Holy Family. In fact, this painting is one of the very few works to have survived from the last phase of her long and prolific career as one of the first women painters in Italy. The Holy Family with Saints Anne and John the Baptist was painted in Genoa, where Anguissola settled when she returned from Spain where she had been an artist at the court of King Philip II. This intimate, candlelit scene depicts the Holy Family in their home in Nazareth. The Virgin Mary, St. Anne, and the infant Jesus are exchanging balls of yarn that have been wound on the metal yarn-winding device depicted behind the familyâ€™s pet dog. The Baptist peers out from behind the table, while Joseph busies himself in the dark recesses of the room, faintly illuminated by the light of the oil lamp he is carrying.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#2f211e

(149.9 Ã— 121.9 Ã— 8.9 cm),"The devotional image of the Madonna and Child accompanied by John the Baptist, sometimes with Joseph or Saint Anne or both, was made popular at the beginning of the sixteenth century by High Renaissance masters Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael. Although employing the same imagery as High Renaissance painting, the Mannerist style of The Holy Family with the Infant Saint John the Baptist locates the work somewhat later in the century. Typically, in a Mannerist painting such as this, the figures are elongated in a graceful manner and their bodies are twisted in a variety of contrapposto postures; they are arranged in an asymmetrical composition and compressed into a shallow space without a clearly defined setting. The unusual combination of intense colors (dark green, bright yellow, pink, and red) together with the unnaturally brilliant lighting further adds to the decorative character of this work, creating the visual effect of a hard, polished surface like that of a finely wrought piece of jewelry.",8.89001778,1,Europe,#e6ad81

There were no people at the former but the houses and palisades were rebuilt and in good order and had been inhabited not long beforeâ€¦.â€� John Webber produced a number of sketches of the area and of its huts while on-site and, upon returning to England, prepared a watercolor that was engraved by B.T. Pouncy (English, d. 1799) for Cookâ€™s official account of his third voyage, published posthumously in 1784. Although Cookâ€™s account reported that the hippah was not in use when they arrived, Webber has added two small groups of figures to the scene. These placid, huddling figures reinforced the concept of the unsophisticated but noble savages, omitting the realities of the complex and ferocious Maori society.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#7e705a

(121.9 x 149.9 x 8.9 cm),"Like his great Flemish contemporary, Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), Jordaens developed a highly naturalistic Baroque style characterized by a dynamic mode of presentation, a painterly approach to form, vivid coloring, and the rich effects of texture. However, in contrast with Rubenâ€™s reliance on idealized, classicizing figures, Jordaens generally used native, commonplace models, most often members of his own family. Here, for example, the three nude goddesses â€“ Aphrodite (to the right of Paris), Hera (in the center), and Athena (shown from the back) â€“ as well as the female personification of Abundance holding aloft a larger cornucopia, are believed to be representations of Jordaensâ€™s young wife, the daughter of his former teacher, Adam van Noort. Painted early in his career, during the period when Jordaens worked as an associate in Rubensâ€™s workshop, The Judgment of Paris illustrates the important moment in classical history when the shepherd Paris, called upon by Zeus to decide who among three goddesses was to receive the golden apple inscribed â€œfor the fairest,â€� awarded the fruit to Aphrodite, thereby precipitating the Trojan War.",8.89,1,Europe,#e2b57c

(134.6 x 99.1 cm)Framed: 61 1/2 x 47 1/2 x 3 in. (156.2 x 120.7 x 7.6 cm),"The biblical story of Judith, the Jewish widow who saved the Israelites by beheading the Assyrian general Holofernes, was an enormously popular subject in European literature and art beginning in the Middle Ages. In addition to her importance as a heroine and defender of her people, Judith was considered a precursor of Christian triumphs, a prefiguration of Christâ€™s victory over death, a prototype of the Virgin and the Church, and the embodiment of many sterling virtues. Judith with the Head of Holofernes illustrates the immediate aftermath of the gruesome slaying. Judith holds the bloodied sword with which she has decapitated Holofernes, but she has not yet given the generalâ€™s head to her maidservant, Abra, to be placed in a basket in preparation for leaving the enemy camp. The heroineâ€™s beauty, fine clothing, jewels, and bared breast remind the viewer of the sexual entrapment that lead to the downfall of Holofernes, whose lifeless head appears less threatening than the grotesque gargoyle on the stool where Judith is seated.",7.62,1,Europe,#291f16

This intimate portrayal of a pretty young woman enticing her brown and white spaniel with a dog biscuit attests to the popularity of such so-called genre scenes among Italian artists. Originally one of five works illustrating the senses, this painting was intended to represent smell; two other surviving works from the series include A Lady with a Cat and a Dead Mouse (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England), illustrating taste, and A Lady with a Dove (City Art Museum, Birmingham, England), portraying hearing.

(24.8 x 36.2 cm),"The other artist referred to in the title of this print is Herman Diedrich SpÃ¶ring (ca. 1733-1771), the Swedish-born secretary who accompanied Banks on Cookâ€™s first voyage. An amateur artist, SpÃ¶ring made numerous drawings for Banks including a pencil sketch executed in October of 1769 at Tolaga Bay, New Zealand. Banks, whose primary interest was botany and documenting the flora and fauna of the Pacific, described the arched rock as, â€œâ€¦ certainly the most magnificent surprise I have ever met with so much is pure nature superior to art in these cases.â€� SpÃ¶ringâ€™s image was re-drawn by others, including Parkinson, and in the original engraving by John James Barralet (Irish, 1747-1815) that appears in Hawkesworth, figures were added to enhance the landscape. A native figure wrapped in a cloth leads two European men along a path to the left. He faces the viewer, holding out his hand as if offering the natural wonder of New Zealand to the viewer. Another Maori man walks along the opposite shore carrying a long fishing spear, while the Endeavorâ€™s pinnace can be seen sailing in the bay. Barraletâ€™s inclusion of figures in this unusual landscape served not only as a visual aid to better describe the grandeur of the sublime perforated rock, but also as an indicator of the perceived status of the relationship between the British and the native Maori. Hoggâ€™s version, by the Dutch engraver, Gerald Sibelius (1734-1785), is a close reproduction.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#6e5e48

Muybridge was sponsored by Pacific Mail Steamboat Company, who hoped his dramatic photographs would spur a return of tourists to steamboat travel. The artist traveled with the full support of the Guatemalan government, which allowed him access to regions otherwise far off the path of most foreigners. The image depicts QuichÃ© Maya women cleaning clothes on stone washboards, probably at the natural hot springs near Zunil. Tzutes and other hand woven cloth can be seen drying on the ground behind them. Young boys help carry baskets of laundry.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#ad9981

As part of their training, young artists were taught to copy and imitate their masterâ€™s compositions. The Madonna and Child is one of several works after a lost composition by Lorenzo di Credi that was derived from Verrocchioâ€™s design of a seated, three-quarter length figure of the Virgin with the Christ Child in her lap, silhouetted against a panoramic landscape. Another version of Crediâ€™s lost composition in the collection of the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo and attributed to his shop, is almost identical to the Loweâ€™s painting. The composition of the Madonna and Child was also employed by a third member of the artistâ€™s workshop, tentatively identified as Antonio Sogliani (1492-1544), for a tondo of the Madonna and Child with Two Angels in the Capitoline Museum Rome.",10.795,1,Europe,#2c2821

(67.9 cm)Framed: 5 x 36 1/2 in. (12.7 x 92.7 cm),"In the hands of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo, the humanist style of late-15th century Italian art, with its concentration on detail and multiplicity of parts, was transformed into a style in which the various elements of the composition were coordinated to create a unified work, recalling the classical perfection of ancient art. Andrea del Sarto was the leading exponent of this new, High Renaissance style in Florence in the first three decades of the 16th century. His paintings are characterized by idealized, weighty figures, which are clearly positioned in space in a balanced arrangement of forms. He was unique among his Florentine contemporaries in his preference for lively color schemes and his inclination toward melancholic expression. Andrea del Sartoâ€™s style was influential for the most important Mannerists of the next generation, including Jacopo Pontormo, Rosso Fiorentino, and Giorgio Vasari, all three of whom trained in his workshop. The composition of the Madonna and Child and the Infant Saint John is a pastiche of designs invented by Andrea del Sarto for other paintings. It was common practice in this period for members of a large workshop to manufacture commercial works such as this painting, using existing preparatory drawings by the master. In this particular case, the figural grouping of the Madonna and Child, which ultimately relies upon Leonardoâ€™s pyramidal designs, was repeated from Andreaâ€™s large altarpiece Madonna with Eight Saints for Saint Dominicâ€™s, Sarzanna (Liguria) of 1528. The figure of Saint John was similarly derived from other devotional images of the Holy Family by Andrea. The ambiguous relationship of the figures to the background suggests that the composition was not actually designed by Andrea himself.",12.7,not found in JSON,Europe,#301710

This altarpiece was painted early in his career, during a sojourn in Naples in 1342-1343. It is of great historical importance because it is one of the few works that has survived intact from the period when the French royal house of Anjou ruled Naples (1266 1435). Two fourteenth-century members of the Angevin family, Queen Elizabeth of Hungary and her son, Price Andreas, who wears a cloak decorated with fleurs-de-lis, the armorial emblem of the kings of France, are shown kneeling at the feet of the Virgin. Their diminutive size and position in relation to the Madonna and Child was customary in Italian medieval art for representing those individuals who donated the painting to the church.

The Madonna and Child in Glory, a small-scale version of a composition that Garofalo employed previously for several large altarpieces, was based on Raphaelâ€™s Madonna of Foligno of 1511-1512, which he had seen in person in Rome. As in Raphaelâ€™s masterpiece, the glorified status of the Madonna is conveyed by her elevated position in heaven, enthroned on clouds. The wide landscape below is a generalized setting used by Garofalo in a number of paintings, but in this context its prominence suggests that the work was intended as a votive offering, invoking the Virginâ€™s protection for a particular but unknown town and its surrounding countryside. More than any other painter outside Raphaelâ€™s closest Roman circle, Garofalo imitated the style of the High Renaissance master. He was also influenced by the rich chiaroscuro effects and the intense colorism of Venetian painters Giorgione (ca. 1477/78-before 1510) and Titian (ca. 1485/90-1576), and that of his Ferrarese colleague, Dosso Dossi.",7.62,1,Europe,#2b262f

The inscription at the bottom of the frame records that the young man was thirty-two years old at the time the work was completed on 16 February 1513, but his precise identity has not been discovered. Like many other artists working in Bruges in the first half of the sixteenth century, Isenbrandt was a conservative painter who maintained fifteenth-century Northern Renaissance traditions of microscopic realism, disguised symbolism, and jewel-like color.

Departing from this iconographic tradition, the infant Christ in Fungaiâ€™s painting is carried by angels on a litter decorated with red and white roses, flowers sacred to the Virgin. This unusual motif is not merely decorative but also symbolic, representing the marriage of Christ, the bridegroom, with his bride, Mary-Ecclesia (the Church), who tenderly touches the chin of her beloved. Witnessing this union is Mary Magdalene, covered with the long hair she grew during her thirty years in the desert as a penitent. Four other saints known for their asceticism and retirement into the wilderness â€“ John the Baptist, Jerome, Francis, and Christopher â€“ also are depicted in the painting.

Diana employed the same composition with slight variations in his Madonna and Child with St. Luke and St. Barbara and a Donor (Collection of the Duke of Portland). The small size of the painting and the inclusion of St. Jerome makes it likely that it served as a private devotional image for someone whose name saint was Jerome.

(24.4 x 36.5 cm),"In December 1774, Cook again visited Tierra del Fuego, this time as he was returning to England at the close of his second voyage. Parkinson and Buchan had made numerous sketches of the Fuegians they encountered during the first voyage, but the man in this print bears a closer resemblance to an engraving by James Basire (English, 1730-1802) after a lost drawing by William Hodges (English, 1744-1797) made during this second visit. Parkinson described the Fuegians in his journal: â€œTheir hair, which is black and streight, hangs over their foreheads and ears, which most of them had smeared with brown and red paint; but, like the rest of the original inhabitants of America, they have no beard â€¦ They wear a bunch of yarn made of guanicas wool upon their heads, which, as well as their hair, hangs down over their foreheads. They also wear the skins of guanicas and of seals, wrapped round their shoulders, sometimes leaving the right arm uncovered.â€�In Basireâ€™s engraving, the man from Christmas Sound stares directly at the viewer with piercing eyes and a cape partially covering his naked chest, much as Parkinson described. Hoggâ€™s version, however, has none of the intensity of the original, sharing only a shaggy head of hair and generally similar facial features. He has replaced the cape with a coat that fully covers the man and added facial hair. Looking away from the viewer, he gestures with his left hand in a motion that would be familiar to European audiences. The woman from Christmas Sound is even less distinct, closely resembling the man except for a slightly smaller frame and longer hair. Only the caption distinguishes the portrait as that of a woman.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#80715a

(25.4 x 36.5 cm),"William Hodges, John Webber (English, 1751-1793), and William Webb Ellis (English, ca. 1756-1785) all sketched Maori women, while some of Sydney Parkinsonâ€™s most well known images depicted the extensive facial tattoos and costumes of Maori men. In his journal, Parkinson described the Maori he encountered: â€œMost of them had their hair tied up on the crown of their heads in a knot â€¦ Their faces were tataowed, or marked either all over, or on one side, in a very curious manner, some of them in fine spiral directions like a volute being indented in the skin very different from the rest.â€� Tattoos were a unique expression of status for both men and women, wrapping the wearer in a layer of spirit power (mana) and creating a visible statement of genealogical claim in a society in which clan affiliation and descent was a matter of paramount importance. Hoggâ€™s engraver has made some effort to distinguish male from female in this print. The Maori woman bears the closest resemblance to an engraving after Hodges from Cookâ€™s 1777 account. Greater liberties have been taken with the man of New Zealand. His simplified facial tattoos and full beard are unusual in the artistic production from the voyages, and he lacks the more commonly depicted Maori hairstyle and costume ornamentation, also an important source of mana, which were described and well represented in the official accounts. During Cookâ€™s first voyage, a number of the travelers were tattooed, including Sydney Parkinson and Joseph Banks (English, 1743-1820), the naturalist and patron of the arts who had strongly supported and sailed with Cook. They and others brought the art form back with them to Europe where, by the end of the eighteenth century, it had become a popular practice.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#8b7b61

His stilted figures appear sculptural rather than human, lacking any sort of animation or individuality. He has added large earrings and a short, beaded necklace to the woman, who wears a turban and longer strings of beads in the original engraving. The manâ€™s facial features, with his long, dark hair and paler beard, are similar to those of the chief and other male figures in the print depicting Cookâ€™s landing on Eua. Both are presented as generic types, styled classically and, like other images in the publication, identifiable only through their captions. This engraving, more than any other, is indicative of Hoggâ€™s somewhat lacking interest in presenting accurate reproductions of previously published illustrations and his employment in some cases of less skillful engravers.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#86765c

The composition depicts the virgin saint kneeling as she gazes heavenward, prior to her torture and eventual martyrdom on the orders of the Roman Emperor Maximinus, seated high above the tumultuous scene in the foreground, in the shadows of background to the right. On the upper portion of the painting, a multitude of acrobatic angels welcomes the soul of the martyred saint, represented as a ghostly figure rising to heaven. The elegantly posed figures, grand architectural elements, warm tonality, and bright illumination are characteristic of Dianaâ€™s early work. A prolific painter of religious altarpieces, ceiling designs, and frescoes, Giacinto Diana was also an influential professor at the Accademia del Disegno in Naples.",6.35,1,Europe,#271b19

Luxor remained very much intact during the Roman period, when the monument was incorporated within the Roman camp and devoted to the cult of the Roman emperor. Later, the temple was surrounded by churches, and by the late sixth century one had been constructed within the first court itself. Nestled within the ancient walls of the court of Ramesses II, and built on the ruins of earlier Christian basilicas, the mosque of Abu el-Haggag represents a tradition of continuous worship at Luxor Temple for almost thirty-five centuries. During the festival of this modern Muslim saint, boats are paraded around the temple, perhaps an echo of the ancient procession of the barks of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu during the Festival of Opet.",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#b9b8b0

Victor Loret found the kingâ€™s mummy in 1898, still resting in his own sarcophagus in his tomb in the Valley of the Kings. At that time, before the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, he was the only pharaoh whose mummy had survived the vicissitudes of continued robbery and defilement and remained in his own sarcophagus in his own tomb. Amenhotep II lay there, wrapped, until local thieves plundered the tomb in 1901. Howard Carter tracked down the later-day robbers, using, among other clues, the imprints of their feet in the dust of the tomb. The mummy, exposed from the waist up by this desecration, was returned to the sarcophagus, and a lamp was placed at its head. In 1931 the mummy was removed for safekeeping to the Cairo Museum.",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#47362e

When the Nubian pharaoh Piye was preparing to enter the temple complex at Karnak, the king instructed his troops: ""When you arrive in Thebes, in front of Karnak, enter into the water and purify yourselves in the river (Nile)...."" This photo appears to have been taken during the time of the Nile's annual inundation. Rains in the highlands of Abysinnia swelled the Blue Nile, which met the White Nile at Khartoum and sent the rising, silt-laden waters north to cover the fields of Egypt. During the summer months Egypt disappeared beneath the brown waters, the whole of the land a vast sheet of water stretching from desert to desert, with the villages protruding like islands from the flood. In antiquity this was a time of increased navigation, festivals in honor of the inundation, booths and bowers on the edge of the swollen river, and festooned boats upon the waters. Since the building of the High Dam, the inundation no longer occurs in the Nile valley north of Aswan.",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#c8c6c8

In this particular case, Coccorante composed two contrasting scenes of the calm and stormy seas which respectively convey a sense of Natureâ€™s grandeur as well as its destructive power. The small figures who carry on their daily lives in the foreground, probably painted by other artists, appear insubstantial against the backdrop of these powerful settings.",7.62,1,Europe,#d0cec2

(72.1 x 60 x 8.9 cm),"The Netherlandish portrait format of a bust-length figure behind a parapet was introduced into Italian Renaissance art by the painter Antonello da Messina (ca. 1436-1479) on his sojourn in Venice in 1475, and thereafter became popular throughout Italy. In this instance, the parapet consists of a narrow ledge that serves primarily as the substrate for the artistâ€™s name: â€œFILI MAZOLA.â€� A second, now fragmentary inscription on the sitterâ€™s collar may once have read, â€œME[I] DEVS ET SIT FORTâ€� (â€œMay God Be My Strengthâ€�). The motto, together with the image of a lamb, a traditional symbol of Christâ€™s sacrifice, on the metal badge on the manâ€™s cap, suggests that he may have been a lay member of one of the many religious confraternities in Italy devoted to prayer and charitable works. At the very least, these elements and the quality of the sitterâ€™s clothing identify him as a wealthy gentleman, most likely from Parma or Milan given the artistâ€™s sphere of activity.",8.89,1,Europe,#25141f

(24.8 x 36.2 cm),"The man on the left wears a gourd helmet with fern fronds attached at the top. Webber sketched the portrait in Hawaii, but neither the mask nor its ceremonial usage is mentioned in any of the voyage journals. James King (English, 1750-1784), an officer who also served as editor of Cookâ€™s account of the third voyage, described it as, â€œâ€¦ a kind of mask, made of a large gourd, with holes cut in it for the eyes and nose. The top was stuck full of small green twigs, which, at a distance, had the appearance of an elegant waving plume; and from the lower part hung narrow stripes of cloth, resembling a beard. We never saw these masks worn but twice, and both times by a number of people together in a canoe, who came to the side of the ships laughing and drolling with an air of masquerading.â€�Webber made several sketches of a Hawaiian dancer he observed in February of 1779, but painted a watercolor for the original engraving by Thomas Cook (English, 1744-1818) and Charles Grignion (English, 1717-1810) after his return to England. As with the masked figure, the dance was described not in the voyage journals but by King: â€œHe held in his hand an instrument [a rattle] â€¦ some bits of sea-weed were tied round his neck; and round each leg, a piece of strong netting, about nine inches deep, on which a great number of dogsâ€™ teeth were loosely fastened, in rows. His style of dancing was entirely burlesque, and accompanied with strange grimaces, and pantomimical distortions of the faceâ€¦.â€�",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#736755

(24.4 x 36.2 cm),"Although John Webberâ€™s original drawing for the manâ€™s portrait is lost, King identified him as the Hawaiian chief, Kanaâ€™ina. He is depicted wearing a feathered cloak and helmet, a costume that King described as being, â€œâ€¦ appropriated to their Chiefs, and used on ceremonious occasions, consisting of a feathered cloak and helmet, which, in point of beauty and magnificence, is perhaps nearly equal to that of any nation in the world.â€� Royal cloaks, made from red and gold feathers, usually included geometric motifs of circle and crescent shapes, and were high status objects worn only by elites. The woven wicker and feather headdress, with its crescent shape arching over the head, represented an extension of the spine designed to protect the mana (spirit power) of the ruler, whose royal body was considered sacred.Webber sketched the young Hawaiian woman on site, and again after returning to England, but did make a number of changes to classicize her facial features in translating his sketch into a design for Sherwinâ€™s engraving. She wears two feathered rings (lei) on her head and another around her neck. The quality of this reproduction, which is probably by George Noble (English, active 1795-1806), is higher than many of Hoggâ€™s other prints. Kingâ€™s extolling of the beauty of Hawaiian featherwork may have encouraged Hogg to take more care with this engraving, which differs only in subtle details.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#7c7161

Although to date, the Loweâ€™s portrait has not been incorporated into Cranachâ€™s established oeuvre, scholars have always attributed the work to the masterâ€™s hand. The sitter has been identified as a scholar on the basis of his black cap, presumably that of a doctor of philosophy, and his heavy, black fur-lined robe. That he was a very rich scholar is evident from the luxurious appearance of the sitterâ€™s clothing, emphasized by the multiple folds of expensive silk brocade sleeves that cover the manâ€™s hands. The Loweâ€™s painting is comparable in style with Cranachâ€™s signed portrait of the successful merchant and city alderman, Moritz BÃ¼chner, of ca. 1520 in the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Art.

In general, the sitter was shown bust-length in profile of three-quarter view. The inclusion of a parapet in portraits originated in the work of the Northern Renaissance artist Jan van Eyck (active 1422-1441). This pictorial device was introduced into Italian Renaissance portraiture by the Flemish-trained artist Antonello da Messina (ca. 1430-1479) during his trip to Venice about 1475. The parapet in these portraits frequently included an inscription with the artistâ€™s name, either carved on the ledge or in the form of a small piece of paper or parchment attached to it. In this case the inscription is indecipherable; it is on this basis of style that the portrait has been attributed to Jacometto Veneziano. Virtually nothing is known about this artist, despite the fact that he was the leading miniaturist and small-scale portrait painter of Venice in the last quarter of the 15th century. Marcantonio Michiel (1470-1547) recorded a great number of his portraits in collections in Venice and Padua in the early 16th century, but modern scholars have identified relatively few of Jacomettoâ€™s works. His half-dozen surviving portraits are of conspicuously high quality, displaying a miniaturistâ€™s approach to refined detail. The man portrayed here, Bartolomeo Cepolla (ca. 1420-1475), was one of the leading jurists of his day. Born in Verona, he was a professor of law at the prestigious University of Padua and a noted author of several legal tracts; he served as Veronaâ€™s representative to the Venetian republic and as an ambassador for Venice. In the mid-16th century this portrait was in the possession of one of Cepollaâ€™s successors at the University of Padua, the noted art collector Marco Mantova Benavides (1489-1582).",7.62,not found in JSON,Europe,#3d2724

(65.4 x 54.6 x 10.2 cm),"The dignified subject of this portrait, Giambattista Memmo (d. 1536), is typical of the individuals celebrated for their individual character and achievements in Renaissance portraiture. Memmo came from one the most illustrious, ancient families of Venice whose members included doges and procurators of St. Markâ€™s, the highest honors attainable within the Venetian oligarchy. A distinguished mathematician and Greek translator, he was awarded a chair in mathematics at the University of Venice in 1530. A copy of this portrait, inscribed â€œGIOVANNI BAPTISTUS MEMMI MDXXIX,â€� is in the Palazzo Mocenigo at San Samuele in Venice. The format of the portrait â€“ a half-length figure in three-quarter view, silhouetted against a deep landscape background â€“ recalls the late portraits of the premier Venetian painter Giovanni Bellini (ca. 1431/6-1516), to whom the Loweâ€™s portrait was attributed when it entered the museumâ€™s collection. Catenaâ€™s mastery in rendering textures is revealed in his refined execution of the sitterâ€™s soft hair and the gold embroidery and delicate folds of his white undergarment.",10.16,1,Europe,#e4dbcf

The subject is believed to be Jean-Baptiste Budes, Comte de Guebriant, who was promoted to commander of the armies of the king in Alsace, Germany, and after distinguishing himself during the Thirty Years' War was named Marshall of France. This painting typifies the paradox that characterizes much French 17th century ceremonial or official portraiture, which embraced, to a limited extent, Italy's Baroque legacy of theatricality and extravagance but largely rejected its excess in favor of a more classical, rational, and subdued style. In this portrait, dramatic contrasts between light and dark elements, as well as elaborately rendered textures, are tempered by a restrained, formal quality, appropriate for the dignified, highly regarded, and reputedly pious subject.",10.16,not found in JSON,Europe,#282218

(97.8 x 85.4 x 7.9 cm),"The taste for portraiture, which developed among the nobility in England in the 16th century, spread in the course of two centuries to the rest of the English upper class. By the 18th century there was an insatiable demand for portraiture, and it was the only branch of painting in which an artist of the period could achieve prosperity. Alongside his bitter rival, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough was considered a leading portrait painter of his day. Gainsborough, who was born in the Suffolk countryside, trained in London and returned to his home around 1750. Although he began producing portraits in a French Rococo style, his preferred subject matter was landscape painting, modeled upon the work of such 17th century Dutch painters as Jacob van Ruisdael and Jan Wynants. In 1759 Gainsborough moved his studio to Bath, England's most fashionable winter resort; he remained until 1774, when the growing demand for his portraits led him to resettle in London. Painted in Bath in the same period as his famous full-length portrait Blue Boy (Huntington Library, San Marino, California), the Portrait of Mrs. Collins portrays the wife of a naval captain in the simple, bust-length format used for family keepsakes. The likeness is undoubtedly accurate, since Gainsborough never worked without the sitter in front of him. Her clothing and jewels are studio props (as is the costume used in Blue Boy), reminiscent of the â€œfancy dressâ€� of Van Dyck's 17th century portraits. Van Dyckâ€™s work was also the source of inspiration for Gainsborough's portraits in regard to posture and gesture, and handling of light, color, and textures. The feigned oval used to frame the portrait of Mrs. Collins was a standard device frequently used by Gainsborough, but the background of the painting is somewhat unusual within his oeuvre; he normally employed a landscape backdrop only for large-scale portraits.",7.938,not found in JSON,Europe,#342a1d

Along with Otago, the son of a chief from Amsterdam Island (Tongatapu), Hitihiti is depicted by Hogg in much the same manner as Potatau and Mai.

(24.4 x 36.5 cm),"Potatow (or Potatau) was a chief of Punaauia, Tahiti. Hodges sketched his portrait in August of 1773 and John Hall later engraved it for the first volume of Cookâ€™s 1777 account of his second voyage. George Forster (German, 1754-1794), a naturalist who accompanied Cook, said of Potatau, â€œHis ample garments, and his elegant white turban, set off his figure to the greatest advantage, and his noble deportment endeared him to usâ€¦.â€� Hallâ€™s original engraving depicted a Tahitian chief with very European or even Middle Eastern attributes, but Hogg has done little to distinguish the physical features of Potatau from those of the man from Christmas Sound, Tierra del Fuego. Although the Tahitian chief is portrayed with a more regal demeanor, his cloak and turban do not accurately reflect the details of native costume that Hodges represented in his sketches.A Raiatean of relatively low status, Omai (Mai) joined Cook for the remainder of the second voyage and returned with him to England, where he stayed for two years. While in England, he was variously presented to British society as a Tahitian chief or the priest of a cult, and Sir Joshua Reynolds (English, 1723-1792), a founder and first president of the Royal Academy, painted a grand portrait of Mai during his visit. Hoggâ€™s engraver has roughly captured the long, softly curling hair that James Caldwall (English, 1739-ca. 1780) added to his original print for volume one of Cookâ€™s 1777 account, but otherwise Hoggâ€™s reproduction shows Mai seated in a stiff side profile with facial features very similar to the other Polynesian men illustrated in the publication. Absent the identifying caption, this could just as easily be a profile portrait of Potatau. Both depictions are types designed to fit into a generic European concept of Polynesian culture, rather than actual portraits of the sitters as individuals.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#70604a

This serene religious genre scene belies the often turbulent events of the king's life. Ptolemy VIII was called, among other things, Physkon, ""pot-belly,"" and classical authors described him as physically and morally disgusting. He was apparently corpulent and fond of gauzy garments that openly displayed his bloated and degenerate physique. He reigned initially with his brother Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II, but he soon chased his brother out of Egypt. Ptolemy VI eventually returned from Rome, and Ptolemy VIII retreated and ruled as king in the Libyan coastal city of Cyrene. On the death of his brother, Ptolemy VIII married Cleopatra II, had his nephew Ptolemy VII killed, and resumed ruling as king in Egypt. This time he was crowned in the traditional pharaonic manner, and married his niece and stepdaughter, Cleopatra III. As a result of this, Cleopatra II chased both Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III out of Egypt, and the pair ruled for a while in Cyprus. Ptolemy VIII finally won back the throne and achieved a reconciliation between himself and his queens.",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#716458

(157.5 x 126.4 x 7.3 cm),"Like his contemporary, Giuseppe Maria Crespi, the Genoese-born painter Alessandro Magnasco was uninterested in the classical concepts of ideal beauty and the formal perfection of contemporary academic art. Attracted instead to the realism of genre painting introduced to Italy by Flemish and Dutch artists, he chose to paint primarily seascapes and landscapes. This seacoast view was painted late in Magnascoâ€™s career, when the artist was in his seventies or eighties. It is the surviving pendant of a pair of large seascape paintings that were originally incorporated into the interior decoration of a palazzo in Genoa. Ostensibly inspired by the scenery of the local seacoast, the scene is essentially a fantasy depicting the aftermath of a nighttime storm at sea and a shipwreck. The next morning, while the seas are choppy and the winds blow fiercely, scavengers have descended on the shoreline to salvage the scattered remains of the ship and its cargo. A precursor of the Romantic landscape painters of the nineteenth century, Magnasco was famous during his lifetime for the originality of his representations of the confrontation between man and nature.",7.302514605,1,Europe,#2b2727

In the scene shown here, the goddess Iousaas cradles the king's head and presents to his nostrils the sign of life, flanked by two signs representing dominion.

(86.4 x 98.4 x 10.2 cm),"The imagery of this painting is unparalleled among surviving secular works of the Italian Renaissance, however, a number of features suggest that it is an allegory about love and marriage. Cupid, the god of love, stands on the bow of the ship, guiding it under the protection of Fortune, represented by a statuette atop the canopy of the throne. Inscribed on the canopy is the Latin phrase: â€œPoems are praised, but costly gifts are sought; so he [the lover] be wealthy, even a barbarian pleases. Now truly is the age of gold: by gold comes many an honor, by gold is affection gainedâ€� (Ovidâ€™s Ars Amatoria, 2.277-78). The sleeping maiden dreams of love, whereas her older companion understands the realities of marriage in the Renaissance Italy: she holds a covered chalice symbolizing constancy and faithfulness, and leans upon the arm of the throne decorated with a relief sculpture of a putto bridling a hybrid monster representing the restraint of lust. The origins of the Ship of Love are unknown, but it probably was part of the lavish furnishings of a bedchamber, antechamber, or study of a patricianâ€™s palace.",10.16,1,Europe,#cbc7c5

These artists adopted a classical figurative approach based on 16th century Italian art and sculpture. This intriguing image of a beautiful, occidental woman hovering within Eastern surroundings, reflects the Victorian fascination with the exotic and the romantic, as well as the interest of the Indian-born artist, who painted a number of similar works. Tales of the white slave trade were popular contemporary subjects of artistic and literary compositions, stories of European women kept as slaves or wives in Middle Eastern harems being titillating, if not factual.

(154.9 x 39.7 x 40.6 cm),"This Neoclassical, or new classical, style sculpture is based on one of the most popular American statues of the 19th century, Hiram Powersâ€™ The Greek Slave (1844), which portrays a Greek girl captured by the Turks and put up for auction in a Middle Eastern slave market. Powers based his statue on an antique statue of the Greco-Roman Goddess of Love, modestly posed to bathe. Known as the Medici Venus, it is a 1st century BCE Roman copy of the lost Greek original by Praxiteles from 4th-3rd century BCE. The dominant mode in art from the 18th century until the mid-19th century, Neoclassicsm sought to capture the severity and ideal purity of ancient art, in rejection of earlier Baroque and Rococo mannerism. Classical work also provided subject matter, stylistic features, and compositional elements for other areas of 18th and 19th century art, such as architecture and painting. The emulation of antique forms was given great impetus by new archaeological discoveries, particularly the exploration and excavation of the buried Roman cities of Herculaneum in 1738 and Pompeii in 1748. The style was further encouraged by theorists, like J. J. Winckelmann, the renowned art historian and archeologist, who produced writings that were influential in calling for artists to imitate Greek art. He claimed that in doing so such artists would obtain idealized depictions of natural forms and their images would then attain a universal significance. â€œFor us,â€� he declared, â€œthe only way to become great is by imitation of the ancients.â€�",40.64,1,Europe,#747883

The well-preserved Ptolemaic temple of Horus was established during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes I (246-222 BCE) on the site of earlier temple constructions and worked on later by Ptolemy X Alexander I (107-88 BCE) and Ptolemy XII Auletes (Neos Dionysos, 80-69/8 BCE). Edfu (in hieroglyphs Db, in Coptic ETBO, from which the modern name derives) stood on the southern border of Egypt at the beginning of recorded Egyptian history. Its original situation as a frontier settlement is reflected in the cultic name of the city, Bhd.t, meaning ""place of the throne."" The chief deity of the city was Horus Bhd.ty, ""Horus of Edfu,"" commonly represented as a falcon, or as a human figure with the head of a falcon. This local Horus was believed to have come to Edfu from Nubia in the south. In later times the ancient Greeks equated Horus with their god Apollo, and called the city Apollinopolis megalÃ©, ""Great City-of-Apollo.""",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#463832

The colossus to the left of the central portal probably broke apart due to seismic activity already during the second half of the reign of Ramesses II. Of the features of the colossi, Amelia Edwards wrote: ""A godlike serenity, an almost superhuman pride, an immutable will, breathe from the sculptured stone. He has learned to believe his prowess irresistible, and himself almost divine. If he now raised his arm to slay, it would be with the serene placidity of a destroying angel."" Beginning in 1963, the temple of Ramesses II and the smaller neighboring temple to his wife, Nefertari, were cut into blocks and removed to higher ground to save them from the rising waters of Lake Nasser, the huge reservoir behind the Aswan High Dam.

Immediately to the south of Hatshepsut's temple, and attached to it, is a sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Hathor. This shrine is a hemispeos, as the inner rooms are partially cut into the rock, an elaborate architectural image of the far-wandering goddess Hathor, eye of the sun, coming out of the desert back into the land of Egypt.

The walls of the Colonnade Hall, now much destroyed, originally extended up to the height of the architraves atop the fourteen massive columns. The inner thicknesses of the doorway into the Colonnade, were originally recessed to receive the leaves of a giant door carved from Lebanese cedar.

(24.8 x 36.5 cm),"Cook arrived at Hawaii during the Makahiki festival, a celebration of the harvest to commemorate Lono, the god of rain and fecundity. This coincidence led to a belief that Lono had sent Cook, and the Hawaiians received him accordingly, venerating him as an extremely high status if not semi-divine visitor. Under normal circumstances, warfare and raiding were endemic in Hawaii as four polities, ruled by elite chiefs with absolute power, vied for dominance, with King Kamehameha of the Kona Coast ultimately emerging victorious.Webber sketched the scene depicting the king, Tereoboo (Kalaniâ€™opuâ€™u), meeting the ships on January 29, 1779. Kalaniâ€™opuâ€™u is seated in the first double canoe with upright lateen sail behind featherwork cloaks that would be gifted to Cook, identifiable by the red and gold watercolor Webber used to highlight his original drawing. The second canoe contained additional gifts of large basketry images and cloth, and the third transported hogs and vegetables. Once on land, Cook participated in ceremonies associated with the festival, and was given a royal cloak, helmet, and flywhisk by Kalaniâ€™opuâ€™u. For the European viewer, the Hawaiian belief that Cook was sent by the gods and the subsequent gifting of objects associated with royalty would have strengthened their conceptions of Hawaiian society as a rustic, Arcadian paradise less sophisticated than the contemporary European world. Here, as well, perhaps in deference to the importance of the scene, Hogg has reproduced his version closely to the original.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#776952

Ramose's tomb shows a clear transition from the artistic standards of the reign of Amenhotep III to the yet more mannered art of the Amarna period, and its carved walls are widely and justly admired for the exquisite beauty of their reliefs. The scene pictured here, in the more restrained and elegant style that predates the Amarna period, depicts two close relations of Ramose - the Overseer of the Horses of the Lord of the Two Lands, the Royal Messenger in All Countries, May, and his wife, Werel. Particularly noteworthy is the contrast between the gem-like cutting of the wig curls and the uncarved swelling of the orbs of the eyes, which are highlighted only in black paint.",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#918888

The burial chamber is remarkable for its roughly hewn ceiling, an undulating surface painted to resemble an arbor with vines and clusters of grapes. Depicted on a pillar in the tomb, Sennofer's wife Meryt presents to her husband a basket containing a golden collar. The accompanying text describes the gesture of her right hand, ""making fast the double heart (amulet),"" referring to the decoration in the shape of two stylized hearts which hangs from Sennofer's neck. Within the hearts are written the prenomen and nomen of Amenhotep II.

Often called a goddess of love, Hathor can also represent seductive danger. This scene suggests the worship of the eye-lioness-uraeus forms of the ""distant goddess,"" whose myth is perhaps best attested by the ""Story of the Departure of Hathor-Tefnut out of Nubia."" Known since the New Kingdom (ca. 1560-1085 BCE), the story tells of the angered eye of the sun, described as the daughter of Ra, a violent goddess in lion form (Tefnut). Retreating into Nubia, she is recalled by Ra, and after she is enticed back to Egypt, she becomes once more the benevolent and happy Hathor. Nonetheless, she requires constant attention, in the form of wine, music, dance, and offerings of desert game, lest she become angry and leave Egypt again.",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#57483a

(83.2 x 158.8 x 11.4 cm),"The Triumph of Caesar depicts the Roman general Julius Caesar being carried in procession, seated on a high dais adorned with an eagle, a symbol of imperial power, wearing a crown of laurel symbolizing victory, and carrying a sword, emphasizing his military prowess. The general is accompanied by his victorious troops and attendants, dressed in sixteenth-century clothing, waving banners and blowing trumpets. The caravan is about to enter the city of Rome where Julius Caesar will be acclaimed by the populace and celebratory games and feasts will ensue. Among the crowd are two captives, swarthy men with turbans, and an elephant, the tail end of which appears at far right of the painting; these minor details suggest that the artist may have intended to represent Casesarâ€™s military victory in Africa or Pontus, a region on the coast of modern-day Turkey. In Renaissance Italy, Julius Caesar was considered the greatest general of the classical world and a model for contemporary military leaders and rulers. Moreover, Renaissance processions emulated the great classical tradition of the triumphal return.",11.43,1,Europe,#8a4d20

Likely produced in the circle of Haarlem painter Pieter de Grebber, an artist who worked for the Dutch court in The Hague, this painting depicts â€œunequal lovers,â€� a popular satirical subject in northern European art and literature. Here the mismatched lovers are an old woman (not a nun) and a young, foolish man, although most typically such images pair an old man with a young woman. With moralizing as well as comic intent, works with this subject expose the folly of those who seek inappropriate sexual partners. The older figures in these parodied relationships desire youth and beauty, while the younger partners are generally characterized as interested only in money, as contained in the chest held by the man in the painting.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#302b23

(24.8 x 36.5 cm),"The principal goal of Cookâ€™s first two voyages had been to confirm the presence of a great Southern Continent believed to exist in the Antarctic region. Once Cook was able to dispel this myth, interest turned to exploration of the northern Pacific. Cook visited the Hawaiian Islands briefly â€“ the first European to do so â€“ while en route to the northwest coast of North America in search of a northern passage linking the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. He had not expected to encounter additional islands that far north, but was welcomed by the Hawaiians with reverence and respect bordering on veneration when he arrived at Waimea Bay, Oahu, in January of 1778. After sailing to the northwest coast of North America, Alaska, and into the Bearing Strait, Cook returned in January of 1779, anchoring at Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawaii, where he was again greeted with veneration and huge crowds of people. Webber drew this view of Kealakekua Bay after returning to England for publication in the official account of the third voyage, for which it was engraved by William Byrne (English, 1743-1805). The lack of a large crowd, reported to have included around 1,500 canoes and upwards of 10,000 people, makes it unlikely that the scene depicts Cookâ€™s arrival. The Resolution and the Discovery dwarf the native canoes gathered around them, and at bottom left, a Hawaiian man paddles toward the British ships on a surf board made of wooden planks. For a reader of the account, this panoramic landscape of the Kona Coast, reproduced by Hogg in its correct orientation, would have reinforced Cookâ€™s initial peaceful welcoming by the Hawaiians and set the stage for the tumultuous events to come.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#81735b

(24.8 x 36.2 cm),"James Cook (1728-1779) first arrived in Tierra del Fuego at the southern end of South America in January of 1769. Communication with the native peoples was difficult and interactions were limited. In his journal, Cook wrote that the native Haush people lived in such a simplistic society, the Europeans, â€œ â€¦ could not discover that they had any head or chief, or form of Government, neither have they any usefull or necessary Utentials except it be a Bagg or Basket to gather their Muscels into: in a Word they are perhaps as miserable a set of People as are this day upon Earth.â€� Both Sydney Parkinson (Scottish, ca. 1745-1771) and Alexander Buchan (British?, d. 1769) made pencil sketches of the Haush, and both drew similar images depicting a group of natives seated around a fire in their hut. Working from these, Giovanni Battista Cipriani (Italian, 1727-1785) created a wash and watercolor drawing, which was then engraved by Francesco Bartolozzi (Italian, 1725-1815) as the first plate in the second volume of the official account of Cookâ€™s first voyage, An Account of the Voyages undertaken by the order of his present Majesty for making discoveries in the Southern Hemisphereâ€¦, by John Hawkesworth, published in London by Strahan and Cadell in 1773. The engraving commissioned by Alexander Hogg (English, fl. ca. 1778-1824), which gives credit to Cipriani as the designer, is a copy after Bartolozziâ€™s print by an engraver named Thomas Morris (British, b. 1750?), who reversed the original in order to make his version.",not found in JSON,1,Europe,#7f7058

The chambers have small apertures high up in the walls, for the admission of light and air - sometimes furnished with a grating of wood. The roofs are formed of palm branches and palm leaves ... laid upon rafters of the trunk of the palm, and covered with a plaster of mud and chopped straw. ... Most of the villages of Egypt are situated upon eminences of rubbish, and are surrounded by palm trees, or have a few of these trees in their vicinity.""

For this reason, a year-round use of small boats was often preferred. Even during the reign of Ramesses II, the fleet that carried sandstone blocks from the quarries of Gebel Silsileh (near Kom Ombo) to Thebes for the construction of the Ramesseum, the king's mortuary temple, consisted of small craft, each of which carried only 5 to 7 blocks, about 15 tons. Attested already in antiquity, the triangular lateen sail was to become during Byzantine times and the early Middle Ages the most important sail of the Mediterranean world. The tall, narrow lateen - perhaps derived from a braided-up square sail with a slanted yard for sailing close-hauled in a hard wind - is well suited to catching the breezes skimming above the Nile between the looming desert escarpments.",not found in JSON,not found in JSON,Europe,#a49f9c

(53.7 x 35.6 x 37.8 cm),"This sculpture is thought to represent Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, smithy to the gods of Mt. Olympus, and maker of all crafts, being crowned with an honorific laurel wreath by Bona Dea (in Latin, ""the Good Goddess""). Most closely associated with metal-working, Vulcanâ€™s forge was said to be located beneath Mt. Etna, the Sicilian volcano (vulcano in Italian), where he created beautiful things, such as thrones for the gods of Mt. Olympus, as well as useful things, like locks that never broke, and weapons and armor for gods and heroes. Married to Venus, goddess of beauty, Vulcan was also closely associated with, and was sometimes said to have been the husband of Bona Dea, whom the artist has depicted holding a cornucopia, one of her attributes. Pepinâ€™s portrayal of Vulcan as a middle-aged man with unkempt hair and beard is a typical representation of the god. However, the artist has idealized the physique, thereby ennobling all craftsmen and their work. As befits the smithy to the gods, Vulcan is seated on an anvil, surrounded by his other identifying attributes, among them a blacksmithâ€™s hammer and tongs. The god Hephaestus was Vulcanâ€™s Greek counterpart.",37.782,not found in JSON,Europe,#e9e9e8

(89.2 x 106 x 8.6 cm),"""In London, what I love more than anything else is the fog,"" said Monet. His great series of the River Thames in fog, sunlight, mist, and smoke, painted between 1899 and 1904, is the outstanding example of Impressionist painting of London. Beginning in September 1899, Monet rented a suite of rooms on the fifth floor of the Savoy Hotel, on the north bank of the Thames. From his balcony he could see Waterloo Bridge to his left and Charing Cross Bridge to his right. He worked quickly from the motifs, switching from canvas to canvas to capture the fugitive impressions of light and atmosphere and then took the paintings back to his studio in Giverny, where he completed them from memory and detailed sketches. He returned to London again in 1900 and 1901, eventually producing more than forty paintings of this busy section of the river. The Lowe's picture depicts Waterloo Bridge backlit by morning sun. The massive solidity of the bridge and its arches evanesces out of the refracted haze of sky and water. Objects are equal with atmosphere, drawing with color, observation with memory. Monet's work, at this mature stage of his career, exists at the intersection of 19th century naturalism and 20th century abstraction.",8.572,not found in JSON,Europe,#909fa9
